# Introduction

* Degraded biological condition in aquatic environments can occur for several reasons. Some causes of poor condition can be effectively managed, others cannot. Fixing or restoring sites can have varying expenses and assurance of outcomes. This is why we prioritize.

* One approach to prioritize is to identify locations where efforts are likely to have desired outcomes. This requires identifying biological constraints or limits on the potential range of biological conditions. Identifying an appropriate context for observed conditions can be used to prioritize.  Context can be defined by models, expert knowledge, and/or defined value sets.

* We don't have good constraint tools to develop a context of expectation of what's possible at a site.  This can help prioritize locations where management efforts will or will not have the intended outcomes. 

* The goal of this study is to demonstrate application of a landscape model to classify and prioritize stream monitoring sites using estimated constraints on biological integrity. The model provides an estimate of context for biological condition that provides an expectation of what is likely to be achieved at a given site relative to large-scale drivers of stream health. The model was developed and applied to all stream reaches in California.  A case study is used to demonstrate how the model can be used to classify and prioritize using guidance from a stakeholder group. 

# Methods

## Study area and data sources

* Brief description of CA, stream types and designated uses, PSA regions, management interests (e.g., southern vs. northern CA)

* Streamcat database used to quantify watershed land use at all sites [@Hill16]

* Streamcat data linked to \ac{nhd} [@USGS14], reach as individual unit for model output

* \ac{csci} as measure of stream integrity [@Ode16;@Mazor16], brief description of index

## Building and validating landscape models

A prediction model of the \ac{csci} was built to estimate likely ranges of scores associated with land use gradients.  Land use parameters were urgan and agricultural land cover in the stream catchment (STREAMCAT). The model is incomplete by design such that \ac{csci} scores were modelled only in relation to landscape-level variables that are not easily targeted by management.  The model provided an explanation of variation in scores related to constraints on biology and unexplained variation was considered representative of additional, unmeasured environmental variables that influence stream biointegrity.  Maybe describe modelling approach in [@Mazor16] - which variables were used to develop \ac{csci}.   

Models were developed using quantile random forests to estimate a range of likely \ac{csci} scores in different landscapes [@Liaw02;@Cutler07].  The model predictions were used to describe where bioassessment targets are unlikely to be met or where streams are unlikely to be impacted.  Calibration and validation data were selected as xyz.

## Classifying streams and prioritizing sites

* Description of SGRRMP and stakeholder group

* Methods for estimating stream class - possibly/likely constrained, possibly/likely unconstrained, certainty and \ac{csci} threshold, some sites were unclassified

* Methods for estimating site performance - over, expected, underperforming, discussion of site types

* Sensitivity analysis - how do classes, performance categories change with thresholds and certainty

* Prioritization of types - stakeholder involvement

# Results

## State-wide patterns

Where does the model perform well, how does performance vary with validation and calibration datasets.

What is the consistency of patterns? For example, percent stream miles as xyz by PSA.

## Case study

San Gabriel River Regional Monitoring Program

Extent, classification, prioritization - probabilistic assessment to make broader conclusions. 

Relationships with environmental variables for constrained/unconstrained locations. Maybe apply to hardened/non-hardened reaches in constrained locations. 

What to do with unclassified streams - typical urban, typical ag. 

*Tables* Priority by type, by perspective

# Discussion

* What do priorities really mean? Depends on your interests, needs, values, etc.

* Link with engineered channels study.
