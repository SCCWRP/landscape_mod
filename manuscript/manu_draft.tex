\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Degraded biological condition in streams can occur from individual or
  multiple stressors acting at different scales (Novotny et al.
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-Novotny05}{2005}; Townsend, Uhlmann, and
  Matthaei \protect\hyperlink{ref-Townsend08}{2008}; Leps et al.
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-Leps15}{2015}). Identifying and mitigating
  causes of poor condition requires an understanding of how stressors
  propogate across space and time. Incomplete knowledge on drivers of
  change or high level of uncertainty in how biology is linked to
  drivers can lead to ineffective management actions. Varying expenses
  and assurance of outcomes (e.g., varying costs and challenges of urban
  stream restoration (Kenney et al.
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-Kenney12}{2012}; Shoredits and Clayton
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-Shoredits13}{2013}))
\item
  Stream restoration relies extensively on identification and
  prioritization of sites where activities are expected to have desired
  outcomes. This requires an understanding of how stressors affect
  biological integrity to place bounds on reasonable expectations for
  what is likely to be a possible outcome of a management action. This
  requires identifying biological constraints or limits on the potential
  range of biological conditions. Identifying an appropriate context for
  observed conditions can be used to prioritize. Context can be defined
  by models, expert knowledge, and/or defined value sets.
\item
  We don't have good constraint tools to develop a context of
  expectation of what's possible at a site. This can help prioritize
  locations where management efforts will or will not have the intended
  outcomes. Biological filters act at different scales (Poff
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-Poff97}{1997}) and we can use this information
  to describe an expectation for prioritization that is scale-specific.
  Landscape-level constraints are particularly relevant for
  macroinvertebrate communities in streams (Sponseller, Benfield, and
  Valett \protect\hyperlink{ref-Sponseller01}{2001})
\item
  The goal of this study is to demonstrate application of a landscape
  model to classify and prioritize stream monitoring sites using
  estimated constraints on biological integrity. The model provides an
  estimate of context for biological condition that provides an
  expectation of what is likely to be achieved at a given site relative
  to large-scale drivers of stream health. The model was developed and
  applied to all stream reaches in California. A case study is used to
  demonstrate how the model can be used to classify and prioritize using
  guidance from a regional stakeholder group. Active stakeholder
  involvement was critical in applying the landscape models to define a
  framework for decision-making because priorities varied with
  management objectives.
\end{itemize}

\section{Methods}\label{methods}

\subsection{Study area and data
sources}\label{study-area-and-data-sources}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Brief description of CA, stream types and designated uses, PSA
  regions, management interests (e.g., southern vs.~northern CA)
\item
  Streamcat database used to quantify watershed land use at all sites
  (Hill et al. \protect\hyperlink{ref-Hill16}{2016})
\item
  Streamcat data linked to \ac{nhd} (USGS (US Geological Survey)
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-USGS14}{2014}), reach as individual unit for
  model output
\end{itemize}

The \ac{csci} (Ode et al. \protect\hyperlink{ref-Ode16}{2016}; Mazor et
al. \protect\hyperlink{ref-Mazor16}{2016}) was used as a measure of
biological condition to assess site performance relative to reach
classification. Benthic macroinvertebrate data used to calculate
\ac{csci} scores were collected at nearly 4800 sites between 2000 and
2014. Field data were collected during baseflow conditions typically
between May and July following methods in Ode
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Ode07}{2007}). The \ac{csci} is a predictive
index of stream health that compares the observed taxa and metrics at a
site to those expected under reference conditions. Expected conditions
at a site are based on models that estimate the likely macroinvertebrate
community in relation to factors that naturally influence biology, e.g.,
watershed size, elevation, climate, etc. The \ac{csci} score at a site
is based on an observed-to-expected ratio of taxa and a \ac{pmmi}
composed of six individual metrics that describe the structure and
function of the macroinvertebrate community. The index score at a site
can vary from 0 to 1.4, with higher values indicating an observed
community with less deviation from reference conditions. Because the
index was developed to minimize the influence of natural gradients, the
index scores have consistent meaning across the state (Reynoldson et al.
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Reynoldson97}{1997}). A threshold score based on
a selected lower percentile of scores (e.g., 10\%) at all reference
sites is used to define nominally low and high scoring sites.

\subsection{Building and validating landscape
models}\label{building-and-validating-landscape-models}

A prediction model of the \ac{csci} was developed to estimate likely
ranges of scores associated with land use gradients. Land use as urban
and agricultural was quantified for the catchment of each stream reach
in California using the StreamCat database (Hill et al.
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Hill16}{2016}). \ac{csci} scores were modelled
using only the the estimates of urban and agricultural land use as the
developed portion of the landscape within each stream reach. The model
was incomplete by design to describe scores only in relation to
large-scale constraints on biological condition that are not easily
controlled by management actions or where costs to mitigate are likely
to be excessive. The remainder of the variation in scores not related to
landscape constraints could be attributed to additional, unmeasured
environmental variables that influence stream biointegrity. Deviation of
observed scores from the model predictions were considered diagnostic of
variation not related to landscape effects.

Models were developed using quantile regression forests to estimate
ranges of likely \ac{csci} scores in different landscapes (N.
Meinshausen \protect\hyperlink{ref-Meinshausen06}{2006}; Nicolai
Meinshausen \protect\hyperlink{ref-Meinshausen17}{2017}). Quantile
models evaluate the conditional response across the range of values that
are expected, such as the lower and upper percentiles of the
distribution, as compared to only the mean response with conventional
models (Cade and Noon \protect\hyperlink{ref-Cade03}{2003}). This allows
use of model predictions to describe where bioassessment targets are
unlikely to be met or where streams are unlikely to be impacted by
placing bounds on the range of expectations relative to landscape
constraints. Random forest models also provide robust predictions by
evaluating different subsets of observations from random splits of the
predictor variables. The final predictions are the averaged response
across several models. These models have been used extensively in
bioassessment applications (Carlisle, Falcone, and Meador
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Carlisle09}{2009}; Chen et al.
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Chen14}{2014}; Mazor et al.
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Mazor16}{2016}) and can produce unbiased
estimates that are relatively invariant to noisy relationships or
non-normal distributions (Breiman
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Breiman01}{2001}; Hastie, Tibshirani, and
Friedman \protect\hyperlink{ref-Hastie09}{2009}). Quantile regression
forests were used to predict \ac{csci} scores in each stream reach from
the 5\textsuperscript{th} to the 95\textsuperscript{th} percentile of
expectations at five percent intervals (i.e., 5\textsuperscript{th},
10\textsuperscript{th}, etc.).

Landscape eestimates for the catchments of all \ac{nhd} stream reaches
in California were separated into calibration and validation data.

\subsection{Classifying streams and prioritizing
sites}\label{classifying-streams-and-prioritizing-sites}

A framework for identifying site priorities for categories of management
actions was developed using a three-step process. First, estimates of
the range of expected \ac{csci} scores at each stream reach in relation
to land use were used to define reach classifications. Second, the
relationship between observed \ac{csci} scores and the reach
classifications were then used to assign a relative performance value
for each monitoring site. Third, site performance categories in relation
to reach classification and bioassessment targets were used to define
management priorities. This framework was developed through close
interaction with a regional stakeholder group with broad representation
of interests in stream management. This process was used to demonstrate
how the landscape model can be used as a management tool given that
priorities will vary by interests and location. As such, the results are
provided as a guide to facilitate decision-making rather than a
prescription of targeted actions to manage stream health.

Stream reach and bioassessment data from the \ac{sgr} Watershed in
southern California were used to develop reach classifications, site
performance categories, and management priorities from the landscape
models. A strong land use gradient occurs in the \ac{sgr} watershed.
Headwaters begin in the San Gabriel mountains where the land is
primarily undeveloped or protected for reacreational use, whereas the
lower watershed is in a heavily urbanized region of Los Angeles County.
The San Gabriel river is dammed at four locations for flood control in
the upper watershed and is hydrologically connected to the Los Angeles
river to the west through the Whittier Reservoir in the lower watershed.
Spreading grounds are present in the middle of the watershed for
groundwater recharge during high flow. Nearly all of the stream reaches
in the lower half of the watershed are channelized with concrete or
other reinforcements.

\emph{Figure} SGR watershed

The \ac{sgr} watershed contains a diverse group of stakeholders from
local municipalities, water districts, water quality regulatory
agencies, consulting groups, and non-government organizations.
Collectively, the \ac{sgrrmp} includes stakeholders from these groups
that cooperatively work to increase awareness of issues in the \ac{sgr}
watershed and work to improve coordination of compliance and ambient
monitoring efforts. The stakeholder workgroup included individuals from
the \ac{sgrrmp} with interests in water supply, improvements to water
quality, habitat protection or creation, and storm water permitting.
Individuals were selected for partipation to include a variety of
mangement interests and based on willingness to adopt tools developed
from the landscape models. The stakeholder workgroup met monthly over a
six-month period to discuss model applications and to refine the
interpretation of results. Stakeholder involement was critical for
developing an assessment framework that met the needs of all engaged
parties and ensured that final products were more likely to be
incorporated into formal processes of decision-making.
