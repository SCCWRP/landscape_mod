# Introduction

* Effective stream management can depend on identification and prioritization of locations where activities are expected to have desired outcomes. 
     * Difficulty defining priorities one site at a time (or setting priorities without data)
     * Placing bounds on known drivers of change can reduce uncertainty in decisions
     * Understanding effects of landscape on stream integrity is particularly relevant for targeted action
     
* We don't have good tools to develop a context of expectation of what's possible at a site.
     * This can help prioritize management actions.
     * Context can be defined by models, expert knowledge, and/or defined values
     * Stakeholder involvement is critical in this process
     
* Goal: demonstrate application of a landscape model to classify and prioritize stream monitoring sites using estimated constraints on biological integrity. 
     * Statewide application of the model
     * A case study is used to demonstrate how the model can be used to classify and prioritize by watershed using guidance from a regional stakeholder group.
     
# Methods

### Study area and data sources

* Brief description of CA, stream types and designated uses, PSA regions, management interests (e.g., southern vs. northern CA)

* Data sources
     * Streamcat database used to quantify watershed land use at all sites
     * Streamcat data linked to NHD, reach as individual unit for model output
     * CSCI as measure of biological condition

### Building and validating landscape models

* Development of landscape model using statewide data

* Ag/Urban land in catchment as predictor of constraint
     * Chosen through vetted stakeholder process at the state level
     * Model incomplete by design, goal of explaining portion of biological response from large-scale constraints
     
* Quantile regression forests and range of model output

* Split between calibration/validation data, evaluation of performance  

### San Gabriel River watershed case study

* Overview of SGR watershed, land use, upper/lower watershed, etc.

* SGR management groups and SGRRMP

* General process of involving stakeholders in developing model, identifying priorities
     * Use of interactive application to facilitate

### Reach classification, site performance, and prioritization

* Summary of framework for identifying site priorities for management actions
     * Reach classifciation - all reaches
     * Site performance - all sites
     * Management priorities - by site types, extrapolated to all sites

* Details about classification framework for stream reaches
     * Range of CSCI expectations at a reach relative to a chosen CSCI threshold
     * Likely constrained, possibly constrained, possibly unconstrained, likely unconstrained

* Details about identifying site performance
     * Sites with observed scores above the upper limit of the reach expectation as "over-performing" and sites below the lower limit as "under-performing", within range as "expected"
     * Identified for each of four reach classications
     * Further identified based on location to CSCI threshold to define "types" to prioritize

* Stakeholder process to assign management priorities by site types

### Sensitivity analyses

* Reach classifications and site performance depend on the range of score expectations and the CSCI threshold

* Sensitivity analysis to evaluate effect of certainty in the model and CSCI threshold (strict, lax) on stream miles by priority category

### Unclassified reaches

* Some reaches were unclassifed if data were insufficient or if a catchment could not be defined

* Latter was more common, particularly in engineered channels or agricultural ditches

* A preliminary approach for assigning biological expectations to unclassified reaches is demonstrated for "typically" urban and agricultural reaches

# Results

### State-wide patterns

* Where does the model perform well, how does performance vary with validation and calibration datasets.

* What is the consistency of patterns? For example, percent stream miles as xyz by PSA.

*Figure* Statewide map. 

### Case study

* Extent, classification, prioritization

* Relationships with environmental variables for constrained/unconstrained locations. Maybe apply to hardened/non-hardened reaches in constrained locations.

*Tables* Priority table(s) from stakeholder group

### Sensitivity analysis

* Statewide results - reach classification, site performance

* SGR application - where do priorities change? Do overall patterns remain?

*Table* Sensitivity results

### Unclassified reaches

* Extent of typical ag, typical urban statewide

* Framework for assigning unclassified reach to a class

* Statewide patterns, SGR patterns

*Table* Summary by location

# Discussion

* What is the value of identifying constrained channels?
     * Use of more data to develop context of assessment
     * Targeted management for desired outcomes

* What is useful about our approach compared to alternatives?
     * Field-based methods to identify modified channels vs. landscape modelling
     * Related directly to biological condition and regulatory standards
     * Results are widely corraborated by other landscape studies - land use is big determinant of macroinvert assemblage

* What contributed to our success in defining priorities? 
     * Stakeholder involvement guided process, contributed to achieving goals
     * An interactive/iterative approach was used - we provided tools to facilitate (web apps) and we did not assume priorities

* Caveats of our aproach
     * What do priorities really mean? Depends on your interests, needs, values, etc.
     * Constrained may not always mean constrained - CSCI vs other biological indicators
     * Site-specific approaches are warranted in certain cases
     * Changing certainty or CSCI treshold - mechanistic effects and implications. Don't cook the books. 

* Future work
     * Link with engineered channels study
     * Priorities statewide, application to larger regions possible (national-scale)
